# Archive Documentation

This directory contains legacy and historical documentation from the roadmap development process. These files are preserved for reference but are **not actively maintained**.

## Archived Files

### CYBERROADMAP_LEGACY.md

**Original roadmap document** from the initial planning phase.

- **Purpose**: Original comprehensive 27-month roadmap before modularization
- **Status**: Superseded by modular documentation structure
- **Contains**: Complete roadmap in single file (before split into phases)
- **Use case**: Historical reference, understanding original vision

**Note**: Current roadmap documentation is split across:
- [roadmap/OVERVIEW.md](../roadmap/OVERVIEW.md) - High-level structure
- [roadmap/PHASE1_MONTHS_1-11.md](../roadmap/PHASE1_MONTHS_1-11.md) - Phase 1 details
- [roadmap/PHASE2_MONTHS_12-18.md](../roadmap/PHASE2_MONTHS_12-18.md) - Phase 2 details
- [roadmap/PHASE3_MONTHS_19-27.md](../roadmap/PHASE3_MONTHS_19-27.md) - Phase 3 details

### ULTRATHINK_ANALYSIS_2024-11.md

**Comprehensive analysis** that shaped the final roadmap optimizations.

- **Purpose**: Deep analysis of original 36-month plan
- **Status**: Analysis complete - all recommendations implemented
- **Contains**: Risk assessment, optimization recommendations, timeline analysis
- **Use case**: Understanding rationale behind roadmap design decisions

**Key optimizations from this analysis** (all implemented):

| Optimization | Before | After |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Certification timeline | M3/M5/M6 (compressed) | M5/M8/M11 (spaced) |
| Kubernetes learning | 4 months (M6-9) | 12 months (M1-11) |
| Recovery months | None planned | M12, M18, M27 |
| Capstone project | Isolated at end | Continuous M1-27 |
| English learning | Vague | 5 structured phases |
| Consulting skills | Mentioned only | Monthly practice |
| Portfolio projects | Rushed at end | 7-8 projects progressive |
| Total timeline | 36 months | 27 months |

## Why Archive?

These documents are archived rather than deleted because:

1. **Historical context**: Understanding evolution of roadmap design
2. **Decision rationale**: The ULTRATHINK analysis explains why certain optimizations were made
3. **Reference material**: Legacy roadmap contains all content in one place (useful for quick reference)
4. **Audit trail**: Preserves development history

---

## Using Archived Content

**DO NOT** use archived files as primary documentation. Instead:

- For current roadmap: Use [roadmap/OVERVIEW.md](../roadmap/OVERVIEW.md)
- For certification guides: Use [docs/](../) folder (CKS, CCSP, CyberArk guides)
- For getting started: Use [GETTING_STARTED.md](../../GETTING_STARTED.md)

**OK TO USE** archived files for:

- Understanding design decisions
- Historical reference
- Comparing original vs. final approach
